  <h1>Overview</h1>
  <p>
    Event ticketing management involves organizing, promoting, and operating events while ensuring that the process of selling and distributing tickets is smooth and efficient. These two areas work hand-in-hand to create successful experiences for organizers and attendees. From concerts and sports games to movie nights and festivals, managing the details of each event and making tickets available in a clear and organized way is key to drawing in audiences, filling venues, and providing a positive, stress-free experience for everyone involved. Through this service, customers can access event venues, dates, and ticket availability, and event coordinators can access ticket sales, capacity, popularity, and ratings.

    This system supports every step of that process. It keeps track of events, their dates, and locations, and allows organizers to assign staff and set up different types of tickets, such as VIP, student, or general admission. Customers can register, browse upcoming events, and purchase tickets while choosing their seats and applying discount codes when available. Venues are linked to their maximum capacity, features, and amenities, while staff assignments and session schedules help events run smoothly. After the event, attendees can leave reviews, giving valuable insight into the success of each event and the experience it provided. These tools all work together to make the event experience organized, informative, and efficient for everyone.
